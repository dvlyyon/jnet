# Textual descriptions of all the various error codes generated by netconf

InUse=The request requires a resource that already in use.
InvalidValue=The request specifies an unacceptable value for one or more parameters.
TooBig=The request or response (that would be generated) is too large for the implementation to handle.
MissingElement=An expected element is missing.
BadElement=An element value is not correct; e.g., wrong type, out of range, pattern mismatch.
BadAttribute=An attribute value is not correct; e.g., wrong type, out of range, pattern mismatch.
UnknownElement=An unexpected element is present.
UnknownAttribute=An unexpected attribute is present.
UnknownNamespace=An unexpected namespace is present.
AccessDenied=Access to the requested RPC, protocol operation, or data model is denied because authorization failed.
LockDenied=Access to the requested lock is denied because the lock is currently held by another entity.
ResourceDenied=Request could not be completed because of insufficient resources.
RollbackFailed=Request to rollback some configuration change (via rollback-on-error or discard-changes operations) was not completed for some reason.
DataExists=Request could not be completed because the relevant data model content already exists. For example, \
           a 'create' operation was attempted on data that already exists.
DataMissing=Request could not be completed because the relevant data model content does not exist.  For example, \
            a 'replace' or 'delete' operation was attempted on data that does not exist.
OperationNotSupported=Request could not be completed because the requested operation is not supported by this implementation.
OperationFailed=Request could not be completed because the requested operation failed for some reason not covered by any other error condition.
PartialOperation=Some part of the requested operation failed or was not attempted for some reason.  Full cleanup has \
                not been performed (e.g., rollback not supported) by the server.  The error-info container is used \
                to identify which portions of the application data model content for which the requested operation \
                has succeeded (<ok-element>), failed (<bad-element>), or not been attempted (<noop-element>).
